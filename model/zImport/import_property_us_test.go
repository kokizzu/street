The Briskin teachers' approach to education is dynamic and creative which results in students who love to learn, debate, problem solve, and are comfortable sharing their opinions and asking questions. Not all of my kids loved taking Hebrew, but each of them took pride in doing well and learning another language. They all matriculated to excellent secondary schools and thrived. Briskin was the best possible place to grow our family.

Also, I'm not religious, but to me now, Judaism is about the community; celebrating life together, feeling grateful for the love we have together, remembering that there are people out there who don't have a voice and we can help them, questioning, sharing and respecting. My child absolutely loves his school. He gets excited for the special days - dress up, Jewish holidays, 6th grade bake sales, field trips, Israeli dance parties and even school projects - even though he is the kid who likes PE the best (PE at Briskin is stellar because of Penny,) but his enthusiasm for learning and knowledge has exceeded my expectations!","reviewedBy":"Parent","reviewerRating":5,"schoolId":39617835,"url":"https://www.greatschools.org/california/los-angeles/20260-Temple-Israel-Of-Hollywood-Day-School/"},{"datePosted":"September 2019","institutionGreatschoolId":620260,"lastUpdatedDate":"October 2023","maponicsId":4208873,"review":"Temple Israel of Hollywood is an excellent elementary school.

As we were touring all the private schools in the area, we decided to stop by the Open House at our zoned public school, Gardner - just to see for ourselves how much worse it would be. We were shocked to find that we loved everything about Gardner! The way it looks and feels (happy! Filled with art, music and laughter), and mostly its progressive mindset. We were so shaken up that we went back two more times to confirm that our initial impression was not skewed in some way... Our son is now a thriving 2nd grader at Gardner, and we truly do love this school.Gardner Street Elementary is a neighborhood gem with an engaged principal, excellent teachers and helpful staff, and a small but very active parent body that makes things happen. Many students live outside the school zone but they and their parents like Gardner so much that they've chosen to permit in.What makes Gardner so special are its diverse staff and students, family-like atmosphere, and the many \"extras\". Thanks to annual fundraisers coupled with lots of fun events for kids and families throughout the school year, \"non-essential\" classes that are not paid for by LAUSD and not offered in many public schools - such as Visual Art, Music, PE, Yoga, Organic Edible Garden, and (new!) Science Lab - are part of the everyday curriculum and available to every child at Gardner. There are many really great afterschool programs to choose from, and occasional workshops for parents/caregivers. Campus beautification is ongoing.Besides all the fun, there is serious learning going on as well. Learning to truly *understand* and not just memorize to ace tests. So much learning goes on at school that - as supported by countless studies and best-performing schools in Finland - there are no homework requirements for the younger kids.Most importantly, my child has developed love for reading and learning, he is excited about going to school every day, and he feels safe there.","reviewedBy":"Parent","reviewerRating":5,"schoolId":39556112,"url":"https://www.greatschools.org/california/los-angeles/2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School/"},{"datePosted":"September 2019","institutionGreatschoolId":602098,"lastUpdatedDate":"October 2023","maponicsId":4226639,"review":"We just love Gardner and couldn't have had a better experience.

When we walked in it felt different than other schools. It was clean, people were friendly and it felt HAPPY! There were happy children around everywhere. It was bright and colorful and pleasant to be in. We have had good teachers, met wonderful parents, and became very involved. The school has a great group of parents running the parent group that raises money all year for the programs that LAUSD doesn't provide. PE, Music, Art, Yoga and Edible Gardening are all only provided because the parents raise the money. And it's not a crazy amount. They aren't hounding you for money. It's usually through fun events like carnivals or dances. They encourage a monthly donation of as little as 5-10 dollars a month and it's totally doable and worth it for what the kids get in the end. Parents don't realize that other public schools don't offer those programs. But Gardner students are thriving thanks to them. We believe in public schools. And LAUSD has a pretty rough reputation, but this is one of those schools that's a diamond in the rough. It is diverse both racially and economically. It's has three main languages spoken among students. It has loving and respectful teachers and administration. Parents that are involved and creating an enriching environment for kids and helping to create a healthier education for them. It's a great size and very inclusive and we are THRILLED to be a part of it.","reviewedBy":"Parent","reviewerRating":5,"schoolId":39556109,"url":"https://www.greatschools.org/california/los-angeles/2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School/"},{"datePosted":"May 2019","institutionGreatschoolId":602098,"lastUpdatedDate":"October 2023","maponicsId":4056201,"review":"I’m running from this school since we day one.

I've said all these amazing things about my school, but I haven't even said anything about the counselors yet! Everyone is great, but by far the most amazing person is Mrs. Brown. Not only is she the SAS counselor, but also the College counselor, the 9/10th grade counselor and someone who will respond to you and doesn't just disregard your concerns. I've met plenty of counselors who you have to hunt down to get a concern in and then still worry if it's actually going to be taken care of, but I can promise you that won't be the case at Hollywood. We have Extraordinary SAS, Outstanding PAM, Amazing administration and to too it all off; there is so much school spirit, enthusiasm and every student I have seen at Hollywood is an individual.

The heart of the school comes from the teachers and not the school director Mrs Yolanda Brown. She needs to stop putting herself into other people's business and let the Principle and teachers run the school. I am wondering should I take my two kids out of this school and send them to another school. That is my only option unless Mrs Yolanda Brown changes her character or have herself replaced by another Director. This school is falling into the abyss and unless we the parents come together and voice our concerns, she will run the school down and our children will lose more than just an education, The school will lose the support of the community that give to the church and school. She tends to show her disrespect among Latinos more than the other families in Blessed Sacrament school. This is not the person who said that she follows Gods path but rather the oposite.

As we were touring all the private schools in the area, we decided to stop by the Open House at our zoned public school, Gardner - just to see for ourselves how much worse it would be. We were shocked to find that we loved everything about Gardner! The way it looks and feels (happy! Filled with art, music and laughter), and mostly its progressive mindset. We were so shaken up that we went back two more times to confirm that our initial impression was not skewed in some way... Our son is now a thriving 2nd grader at Gardner, and we truly do love this school.Gardner Street Elementary is a neighborhood gem with an engaged principal, excellent teachers and helpful staff, and a small but very active parent body that makes things happen. Many students live outside the school zone but they and their parents like Gardner so much that they've chosen to permit in.What makes Gardner so special are its diverse staff and students, family-like atmosphere, and the many \"extras\". Thanks to annual fundraisers coupled with lots of fun events for kids and families throughout the school year, \"non-essential\" classes that are not paid for by LAUSD and not offered in many public schools - such as Visual Art, Music, PE, Yoga, Organic Edible Garden, and (new!) Science Lab - are part of the everyday curriculum and available to every child at Gardner. There are many really great afterschool programs to choose from, and occasional workshops for parents/caregivers. Campus beautification is ongoing.Besides all the fun, there is serious learning going on as well. Learning to truly *understand* and not just memorize to ace tests. So much learning goes on at school that - as supported by countless studies and best-performing schools in Finland - there are no homework requirements for the younger kids.Most importantly, my child has developed love for reading and learning, he is excited about going to school every day, and he feels safe there.","reviewedBy":"Parent","reviewerRating":5,"schoolId":39556112,"url":"https://www.greatschools.org/california/los-angeles/2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School/"},{"datePosted":"September 2019","institutionGreatschoolId":602098,"lastUpdatedDate":"October 2023","maponicsId":4226639,"review":"We just love Gardner and couldn't have had a better experience.

The school has a great group of parents running the parent group that raises money all year for the programs that LAUSD doesn't provide. PE, Music, Art, Yoga and Edible Gardening are all only provided because the parents raise the money. And it's not a crazy amount. They aren't hounding you for money. It's usually through fun events like carnivals or dances. They encourage a monthly donation of as little as 5-10 dollars a month and it's totally doable and worth it for what the kids get in the end. Parents don't realize that other public schools don't offer those programs. But Gardner students are thriving thanks to them. We believe in public schools. And LAUSD has a pretty rough reputation, but this is one of those schools that's a diamond in the rough. It is diverse both racially and economically. It's has three main languages spoken among students. It has loving and respectful teachers and administration.

As we were touring all the private schools in the area, we decided to stop by the Open House at our zoned public school, Gardner - just to see for ourselves how much worse it would be. We were shocked to find that we loved everything about Gardner! The way it looks and feels (happy! Filled with art, music and laughter), and mostly its progressive mindset. We were so shaken up that we went back two more times to confirm that our initial impression was not skewed in some way... Our son is now a thriving 2nd grader at Gardner, and we truly do love this school.Gardner Street Elementary is a neighborhood gem with an engaged principal, excellent teachers and helpful staff, and a small but very active parent body that makes things happen. Many students live outside the school zone but they and their parents like Gardner so much that they've chosen to permit in.What makes Gardner so special are its diverse staff and students, family-like atmosphere, and the many \"extras\". Thanks to annual fundraisers coupled with lots of fun events for kids and families throughout the school year, \"non-essential\" classes that are not paid for by LAUSD and not offered in many public schools - such as Visual Art, Music, PE, Yoga, Organic Edible Garden, and (new!) Science Lab - are part of the everyday curriculum and available to every child at Gardner. There are many really great afterschool programs to choose from, and occasional workshops for parents/caregivers. Campus beautification is ongoing.Besides all the fun, there is serious learning going on as well. Learning to truly *understand* and not just memorize to ace tests. So much learning goes on at school that - as supported by countless studies and best-performing schools in Finland - there are no homework requirements for the younger kids.Most importantly, my child has developed love for reading and learning, he is excited about going to school every day, and he feels safe there.","reviewedBy":"Parent","reviewerRating":5,"schoolId":39556112,"url":"https://www.greatschools.org/california/los-angeles/2098-Gardner-Street-Elementary-School/"},{"datePosted":"September 2019","institutionGreatschoolId":602098,"lastUpdatedDate":"October 2023","maponicsId":4226639,"review":"We just love Gardner and couldn't have had a better experience.

It was bright and colorful and pleasant to be in. We have had good teachers, met wonderful parents, and became very involved. The school has a great group of parents running the parent group that raises money all year for the programs that LAUSD doesn't provide. PE, Music, Art, Yoga and Edible Gardening are all only provided because the parents raise the money. And it's not a crazy amount. They aren't hounding you for money. It's usually through fun events like carnivals or dances. They encourage a monthly donation of as little as 5-10 dollars a month and it's totally doable and worth it for what the kids get in the end. Parents don't realize that other public schools don't offer those programs. But Gardner students are thriving thanks to them. We believe in public schools. And LAUSD has a pretty rough reputation, but this is one of those schools that's a diamond in the rough. It is diverse both racially and economically. It's has three main languages spoken among students. It has loving and respectful teachers and administration.
